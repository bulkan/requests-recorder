TCPWatch is a utility written in Python that lets you monitor forwarded TCP
connections or HTTP proxy connections. It displays the sessions in a window
with a history of past connections. It is useful for developing and debugging
protocol implementations and web services.

Version 1.3 is compatible with Tkinter installations that use threads. See the
change log for a list of other changes.

TCPWatch is licensed under ZPL 2.0 and requires Python 2.1 or later.
